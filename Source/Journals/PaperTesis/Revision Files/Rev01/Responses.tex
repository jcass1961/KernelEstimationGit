\AR We have made the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item We have added the reference by \citet{SARImageStatisticalModelingPartISinglePixelStatisticalModels}, which is a modern and comprehensive survey about speckle.
\item 
\item 
\item We added ``and $\Omega$ is the parameter space.'' to the sentence after~(1).
\item We changed the text as follows
		\begin{quote}
	In particular, several measures have been proposed to reflect the closeness  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{between two distribution functions.} \DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{among the models that describe samples.}\DIFaddend
		\end{quote}
\item It was wrong; we corrected it and now it reads ``$\alpha \in (-1,-3)$''.
\item 
\item 
\item 
\item We changed the text as follows:
	\begin{quote}		
	It is essential to have measures that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{quality} \DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{quantify }\DIFaddend the quality of the estimation. 
	\end{quote}
\item We deleted the word ``techniques''.
\end{itemize}
