	abstract = {A new technique for the acceleration of iterative image restorationalgorithms is proposed. The method is based on the principles of vectorextrapolation and does not require the minimization of a cost function. Thealgorithm is derived and its performance illustrated withRichardson--Lucy (R--L) and maximum entropy (ME) deconvolutionalgorithms and the Gerchberg--Saxton magnitude and phase retrievalalgorithms. Considerable reduction in restoration times is achieved withlittle image distortion or computational overhead per iteration. The speedupachieved is shown to increase with the number of iterations performed and iseasily adapted to suit different algorithms. An example R--L restorationachieves an average speedup of 40 times after 250 iterations and an ME method20 times after only 50 iterations. An expression for estimating theacceleration factor is derived and confirmed experimentally. Comparisons withother acceleration techniques in the literature reveal significantimprovements in speed and stability.},

	abstract = {In this Letter, we study the observed distributions of rotational velocity in a sample of more than 16,000 nearby F and G dwarf stars, magnitude complete, and presenting high-precision Vsin i measurements. We show that the velocity distributions cannot be fitted by a Maxwellian. In addition, an analysis based on both Tsallis and Kaniadakis power-law statistics is by far the most appropriate statistics and gives a very good fit. It is also shown that single and binary stars have similar rotational distributions. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that these two new statistics have been tested for the rotation of such a large sample of stars, pointing solidly to a solution of the puzzling problem of the function governing the distribution of stellar rotational velocity.}
