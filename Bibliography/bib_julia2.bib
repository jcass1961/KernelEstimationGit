	signal dependent noise known as speckle, which is due to the radar
	wave coherence. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive despeckling
	filter and derive a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator for the
	radar cross section (RCS). We first employ a logarithmic transformation
	to change the multiplicative speckle into additive noise. We model
	the RCS using the recently introduced heavy-tailed Rayleigh density
	function, which was derived based on the assumption that the real
	and imaginary parts of the received complex signal are best described
	using the alpha-stable family of distribution. We estimate model
	parameters from noisy observations by means of second-kind statistics
	theory, which relies on the Mellin transform. Finally, we compare
	the proposed algorithm with several classical speckle filters applied
	on actual SAR images. Experimental results show that the homomorphic
	MAP filter based on the heavy-tailed Rayleigh prior for the RCS is
	among the best for speckle removal},

	abstract = {Many applications consecrate the use of asymmetric distributions,
	and practical situations often require robust parametric inference.
	This paper presents the derivation of M-estimators with asymmetric
	influence functions, motivated by the GA0 distribution. This law,
	regarded as the universal model for speckled imagery, can be highly
	skewed and maximum likelihood estimation can be severely hampered
	by small percentages of outliers. These outliers appear mainly because
	the hypothesis of independence and equal distribution of observations
	are seldom satisfied in practice; for instance, in the process of
	filtering, some pixels within a window frequently come from regions
	with different underlying distributions. Traditional robust estimation
	methods, on the basis of symmetric robustifying functions, assume
	that the distribution is symmetric, but when the data distribution
	is asymmetric, these methods yield biased estimators. Empirical influence
	functions for maximum likelihood estimators are computed, and based
	on this information we propose the asymmetric M-estimator (AM-estimator),
	an M-estimator with asymmetric redescending functions. The performance
	of AM estimators is assessed, and it is shown that they either compete
	with or outperform both maximum likelihood and Huber-type M-estimators.},

	It can be seen that Maximum Likelihood and moment estimators for

	hence, it is of outmost importance to find Robust Estimators for
	these parameters. One of the best-known classes of robust techniques

	estimation method. In this work we derive the M-estimators for the

	under the presence of corner reflectors, a common source of contamination
	in SAR images. Numerical issues are addressed, and a practical example

	abstract = {This paper's aim is to evaluate the effectivess of bootstrap methods
	in improving estimation of clutter properties in speckled imagery.
	Estimation is performed by standard maximum likelihood methods. We
	show that estimators obtained this way can be quite biased in finite
	samples, and develop bias correction schemes using bootstrap resampling.
	In particular, we propose a bootstrapping scheme which is an adaptation
	of that proposed by Efron (1990). The proposed bootstrap does not
	require the quantity of interest to have closed-form, as does Efron's
	original proposal. The adaptation we suggest is particularly important
	since the maximum likelihood estimator of interest does not have
	a closed-form. We show that this particular bootstrapping scheme
	outperforms alternative forms of bias reduction mechanisms, thus
	delivering more accurate inference. We also consider interval estimation
	using bootstrap methods, and show that a particular parametric bootstrap-based
	confidence interval is typically more reliable than both the asymptotic
	confidence interval and other bootstrap-based confidence intervals.
	An application to real data is presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with numerical problems arising when performing maximum
	likelihood parameter estimation in speckled imagery using small samples.
	The noise that appears in images obtained with coherent illumination,
	as is the case of sonar, laser, ultrasound-B, and synthetic aperture
	radar, is called speckle, and it can neither be assumed Gaussian
	nor additive. The properties of speckle noise are well described
	by the multiplicative model, a statistical framework from which stem
	several important distributions. Amongst these distributions, one
	is regarded as the universal model for speckled data, namely, the
	G0 law. This paper deals with amplitude data, so the GA0 distribution
	will be used. The literature reports that techniques for obtaining
	estimates (maximum likelihood, based on moments and on order statistics)
	of the parameters of the GA0 distribution require samples of hundreds,
	even thousands, of observations in order to obtain sensible values.
	This is verified for maximum likelihood estimation, and a proposal
	based on alternate optimization is made to alleviate this situation.
	The proposal is assessed with real and simulated data, showing that
	the convergence problems are no longer present. A Monte Carlo experiment
	is devised to estimate the quality of maximum likelihood estimators
	in small samples, and real data is successfully analyzed with the
	proposed alternated procedure. Stylized empirical influence functions
	are computed and used to choose a strategy for computing maximum
	likelihood estimates that is resistant to outliers.},

	imagery with pointwise Gaussian Maximum Likelihood (ML) and contextual
	ICM (Iterated Conditional Modes), with and without errors in the
	training stage. Two experimental setups were considered in order
	to assess the influence of using partial and low quality information
	and to make a quantitative comparison of ML and ICM in real situations.
	Using simulation the ground truth is known and, therefore, precise
	comparisons are possible. The contextual approach proved being superior
	than the pointwise one, at the expense of requiring more computational
	resources, with both real and simulated data. Pseudolikelihood parameter
	estimation for the context is used, and we provide the expression
	for estimating this parameter when using the multiclass Potts model
	with eight neighbours. Quantitative and qualitative results are discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an image segmentation method for synthetic aperture
	radar (SAR), exploring statistical properties of SAR data to characterize
	image regions. We consider GA0 distribution parameters for SAR image
	segmentation, combined to the level set framework. The GA0 distribution
	belongs to a class of G distributions that have been successfully
	used to model different regions in amplitude SAR images for data
	modeling purpose. Such statistical data model is fundamental to deriving
	the energy functional to perform region mapping, which is input into
	our level set propagation numerical scheme that splits SAR images
	into homogeneous, heterogeneous, and extremely heterogeneous regions.
	Moreover, we introduce an assessment procedure based on stochastic
	distance and the GA0 model to quantify the robustness and accuracy
	of our approach. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithms
	regarding experiments on synthetic and real SAR data.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the
	roughness parameter of the distribution for speckled imagery (Frery
	et al., 1997). We discover that when a certain criterion is satisfied
	by the sample moments, the likelihood function is monotone and MLE
	estimates are infinite, implying an extremely homogeneous region.
	We implement three corrected estimators in an attempt to obtain finite
	parameter estimates. Two of the estimators are taken from the literature
	on monotone likelihood ([Firth, 1993] and [Jeffreys, 1946]) and one,
	based on resampling, is proposed by the authors. We perform Monte
	Carlo experiments to compare the three estimators. We find the estimator
	based on the Jeffreys prior to be the worst. The choice between Firth's
	estimator and the Bootstrap estimator depends on the value of the
	number of looks (which is given before estimation) and the specific
	needs of the user. We also apply the estimators to real data obtained
	from synthetic aperture radar (SAR). These results corroborate the
	Monte Carlo findings. Further clarification of the choice between
	the Firth and Bootstrap estimators will be obtained through future
	studies of the classification properties of these estimators.},

	abstract = {A new classifier for Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images is proposed
	and assessed in this paper. Its input consists of segments, and each
	one is assigned the class which minimizes a stochastic distance.
	Assuming the complex Wishart model, several stochastic distances
	are obtained from the $\hphi$ family of divergences, and they are
	employed to derive hypothesis test statistics that are also used
	in the classification process. This article also presents, as a novelty,
	analytic expressions for the test statistics based on the following
	stochastic distances between complex Wishart models: Kullback-Leibler,
	Bhattacharyya, Hellinger, R\'enyi, and Chi-Square; also, the test statistic
	based on the Bhattacharyya distance between multivariate Gaussian
	distributions is presented. The classifier performance is evaluated
	using simulated and real PolSAR data. The simulated data are based
	on the complex Wishart model, aiming at the analysis of the proposal
	well controlled data. The real data refer to the complex L-band image,
	acquired during the 1994 SIR-C mission. The results of the proposed
	classifier are compared with those obtained by a Wishart per-pixel/contextual
	classifier, and we show the better performance of the region-based
	classification. The influence of the statistical modeling is assessed
	by comparing the results using the Bhattacharyya distance between
	multivariate Gaussian distributions for amplitude data. The results
	with simulated data indicate that the proposed classification method
	has a very good performance when the data follow the Wishart model.
	The proposed classifier also performs better than the per-pixel/contextual
	classifier and the Bhattacharyya Gaussian distance using SIR-C PolSAR
	data.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. The problem of boundary bias is associated with kernel estimation for regression curves with compact support. This paper proposes a simple and uni(r)ed approach for remedying boundary bias in non-parametric regression, without dividing the compact support into interior and boundary areas and without applying explicitly different smoothing treatments separately. The approach uses the beta family of density functions as kernels. The shapes of the kernels vary according to the position where the curve estimate is made. Theyare symmetric at the middle of the support interval, and become more and more asymmetric nearer the boundary points. The kernels never put any weight outside the data support interval, and thus avoid boundary bias. The method is a generalization of classical Bernstein polynomials, one of the earliest methods of statistical smoothing. The proposed estimator has optimal mean integrated squared error at an order of magnitude n−4/5, equivalent to that of standard kernel estimators when the curve has an unbounded support.},

	Abstract                 = {Images obtained with coherent illumination, as is the case of sonar, ultrasound-B, laser and Synthetic Aperture Radar -- SAR, are affected by speckle noise which reduces the ability to extract information from the data. Specialized techniques are required to deal with such imagery, which has been modeled by the G0 distribution and under which regions with different degrees of roughness and mean brightness can be characterized by two parameters; a third parameter, the number of looks, is related to the overall signal-to-noise ratio. Assessing distances between samples is an important step in image analysis; they provide grounds of the separability and, therefore, of the performance of classification procedures. This work derives and compares eight stochastic distances and assesses the performance of hypothesis tests that employ them and maximum likelihood estimation. We conclude that tests based on the triangular distance have the closest empirical size to the theoretical one, while those based on the arithmetic-geometric distances have the best power. Since the power of tests based on the triangular distance is close to optimum, we conclude that the safest choice is using this distance for hypothesis testing, even when compared with classical distances as Kullback-Leibler and Bhattacharyya.},

The density functions have bounded support on [0,1). Both BS and LN kernel estimators are free of boundary bias, non-negative, with natural varying shape, and achieve the optimal rate of convergence for the mean integrated squared error. We apply BS and LN kernel density estimators to high frequency intraday time duration data. The comparisons are made on several nonparametric kernel density estimators. BS and LN kernels perform better near the boundary in terms of bias reduction.},

	abstract={This paper analyses various estimators for characterizing synthetic aperture radar clutter textures. First, we consider maximum likelihood estimators, which require specific knowledge of the form of the probability distribution of the data but would be expected to yield the best performance. Both K- and Weibull-distributed clutter models, which are often applied to characterize natural SAR clutter, are considered. Though a full maximum likelihood solution is impossible for the K distribution, we derive an approximate one for the multi-look case. We next derive expressions for limiting errors in a variety of direct texture estimators and compare their predicted performance with the maximum likelihood estimates in a search for robust, optimum texture estimators.}

	ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we extend and overview wide families of Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-divergences and discuss their fundamental properties. In literature usually only one single asymmetric (Alpha, Beta or Gamma) divergence is considered. We show in this paper that there exist families of such divergences with the same consistent properties. Moreover, we establish links and correspondences among these divergences by applying suitable nonlinear transformations. For example, we can generate the Beta-divergences directly from Alpha-divergences and vice versa. Furthermore, we show that a new wide class of Gamma-divergences can be generated not only from the family of Beta-divergences but also from a family of Alpha-divergences. The paper bridges these divergences and shows also their links to Tsallis and Rényi entropies. Most of these divergences have a natural information theoretic interpretation.},

By analyzing and resolving the inherent dependencies of some of its search steps, we propose an efficient GPU-based parallel implementation of L-BFGS-B on the GPU. We justify our design decisions and demonstrate significant speed-up by our parallel implementation in solving the centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) problem as well as some typical computing problems.},

	abstract="Since speckle plays an important role in many physical phenomena, it is essential to fully understand its statistical properties. Starting from the basic idea of a random walk in the complex plane, we derive the first-order statistics of the complex amplitude, intensity and phase of speckle. Sums of speckle patterns are also considered, the addition being either on an amplitude or on an intensity basis, with partially polarized speckle being a special case. Next we consider the sum of a speckle pattern and a coherent background, deriving the first-order probability density functions of intensity and phase. Attention is then turned to second-order statistics. The autocorrelation function and power spectral density are derived, both for a free-space propagation geometry and for an imaging geometry. In some cases the recorded speckle pattern may be spatially integrated or blurred, and accordingly consideration is given to the statistics of such patterns. Finally, the relationship between detailed surface structure and the resulting speckle pattern is explored, with emphasis on the effects of the surface autocorrelation function and the effects of finite surface roughness.",

	ABSTRACT = {Due to the inherent characteristics of the electromagnetic wave scattering phenomenon, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are directly degraded by high-frequency multiplicative speckle (HMS) noise, which makes image de-speckling filter application and selection a challenge. In this regard, an adverse effects analysis of the HMS under implementation of seven different spatial de-speckling filters on a reference SAR image is considered in this paper. The investigation includes the formulation of the backscattered data and the HMS based on the pixel statistics and their distribution as an image noise behavioral analysis method. The resulting complex behavioral model is used for HMS power spectral density (PSD) function modeling. This paper also includes HMS system resolution effects analysis on the raw data generation (RDG) and the received frequency profile (RFP). An objective quality assessment procedure was also carried out to investigate both the de-speckled image resolution and the spatial filter evaluation in the presence of the HMS. As a result, the simulations verify that speckles are embedded within the high-frequency parts of the raw data, directly affecting the spatial resolution and the image resolution with non-specific patterns. The results also show that no spatial de-speckling filter consistently outperforms others, and their implementation is completely dependent on the texture, the system parameters, and their evaluation index. As a novel approach, HMS spectral behavioral modeling within the filtered images, as well as the proposed spatial de-speckling filter evaluation methods, are the proper techniques for optimum filter selection and specific purpose applications. The results are very helpful for remote sensing image restoration and data preservation when dealing with SAR images with a less fine resolution, such as ice-covered areas, coastal change detection, vegetation texture detection, geological structures mapping, and so forth. The SAR system resolution analysis is completed based on inversed problem solution (IPS) and with the help of a hybrid-domain image formation algorithm (IFA).},

	ABSTRACT = {This paper address unsupervised classification strategies applied to Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images. We analyze the performance of complex Wishart distribution, which is a widely used model for multi-look PolSAR images, and the robustness of five stochastic distances (Bhattacharyya, Kullback-Leibler, R&eacute;nyi, Hellinger and Chi-square) between Wishart distributions. Two unsupervised classification strategies were chosen: the Stochastic Clustering (SC) algorithm, which is based on the K-means algorithm but uses stochastic distance as the similarity metric, and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for Wishart Mixture Model. With the aim of assessing the performance of all algorithms presented here, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation over a set of simulated PolSAR images. A second experiment was conducted using the study area of Tapaj&oacute;s National Forest and the surrounding area, in Brazilian Amazon Forest. The PolSAR images were obtained by the satellite PALSAR. The results, in both experiments, suggest that the EM algorithm and the SC with Hellinger and the SC with Bhattacharyya distance provide a better classification performance. We also analyze the initialization problem for SC and EM algorithms, and we demonstrate how the initial centroid choice influences the final classification result.},

In order to detect the boundary of a region, initial B-Spline curves are specified, either automatically or manually, and the proposed algorithm uses a deformable contours technique to find the boundary. In doing this, the parameters of the polarimetric GHP model for the data are estimated, in order to find the transition points between the region being segmented and the surrounding area. This is a local algorithm since it works only on the region to be segmented. Results of its performance are presented.},

The new estimators are obtained by modifying the estimators suggested by Noughabi and Arghami (2010) and Ebrahim et al. (1994). In terms of the root mean square error (RMSEs) and bias values, a numerical comparison is considered to compare the suggested estimators with Vasicek’s (1976) estimator. Our results reveal that the suggested estimators have smaller mean squared error than Vasicek’s estimator. Also, the suggested estimators under double ranked set sampling are more efficient than other suggested estimators based on SRS and RSS.}

For this research, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) based images gives good support in mapping the variation between the remote sensing data analysis. This paper presents an approach to map the different target signatures available in the radar image using support vector machine by providing limited amount of reference data. The proposed methodology takes a preprocess expansion of transforming the grayscale image into a synthetic color image which is often used with radar data to improve the display of subtle large-scale features. Hue Saturation Value based sharpened Synthetic Aperture Radar images are used as the input to supervised classifier in which evaluation metrics are considered to assess both the phase of the approach. Based on the evaluation, Support Vector Machine classifier with linear kernel has been known to strike the right balance between accuracy obtained on a given finite amount of training patterns and the facility to generalize to undetected data.",

It is well-known that these images are affected by speckle and prone to extreme values due to double bounce and corner reflector. The G0I distribution is flexible enough to model different degrees of texture in speckled data. It is indexed by three parameters: alpha, related to the texture, gamma, a scale parameter, and L, the number of looks. Quality estimation of alpha is essential due to its immediate interpretability. In this letter, we exploit the connection between the G0I and Pareto distributions. With this, we obtain six estimators that have not been previously used in the SAR literature. We compare their behavior with others in the noisiest case for monopolarized intensity data, namely single look case. We evaluate them using Monte Carlo methods for noncontaminated and contaminated data, considering convergence rate, bias, mean squared error, and computational time. We conclude that two of these estimators based on the Pareto law are the safest choices when dealing with actual data and small samples, as is the case of despeckling techniques and segmentation, to name just two applications. We verify the results with an actual SAR image.},
